# JavaScript
This repository contains the assignments and projects that I was tasked to complete. This repository also shares relations with HTML
and CSS. Throughout this repo you will notice HTML files referencing JavaScript files and also CSS files relating to HTML. These assignments allowed me to understand how and what JavaScript is capable of.

## Reason
In most cases I will use JavaScript to make webpages more dynamic and interactive. But there are plenty of other uses of JavaScript in this repo. From a functional calculator to a webpage on how to order pizza, you will discover the many uses I had for JavaScript. Theres even a tic-tac-toe game that uses images and sound clips.

## Please feel free to look through my repository!
I am the only person involved in this repository and I take great pride in what I was able to accomplish. Please reach-out to me with
any questions you have. The final project in this repo is the tic-tac-toe program.
