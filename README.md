# JavaScript
This repository contains the assignments and projects that I was tasked to complete. This repository also shares relations with HTML
and CSS. Throughout this repo you will notice HTML referencing JavaScript files and also CSS files relating to HTML. These assignments
allowed me understand how and what JavaScript is capable of.

## Reason
In most all of the repo I execute the use JavaScript to make pages more dynamic. In the same repo you will discover multiple projects
that I completed, some will be more complex than others. From a calculator to a webpage on how to order pizza, you will discover the many
uses I had for JavaScript. I even used it to make a functional tic-tac-toe game, with the help of HTML and CSS.

## Please feel free to look through my repository!
I am the only person involved in this repository and I take great pride in what I was able to accomplish. Please reach-out to me with
any questions you have. The final project in this repo is the tic-tac-toe program.
